## My process

I started by setting up the basic HTML  structure and focused on matching the spacing and typography from the design.
Since I did not use figma so its a little hard to think what padding and marging will be good so for this topic I took some help from GPT for that part.
Then i made sure everything looked good on smaller screens by adding a mobile media query.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project was more of a **revision** for me.
<br>
I revisited HTML and CSS fundamentals like flexbox , containers and all.
<br>
It helped me refresh my understanding of responsive design and clean code practices.

### Continued development

I am going to focus more on **flexbox** and **grid**, these two are the main topics that i need to give focus its not like i dont know these , but its like there's more room for improvement in these 2 topics.

### Useful resources

**GPT** is the one who helped to me to know margin and paddings.
